### Types of Hosting Services

- **`Shared Hosting:`**

  - In a shared hosting service, a single server hosts multiple websites simultaneously. Each website resides on a different location of the hard drive and hence is separated from the other websites. However, the server’s resources are shared among all the hosted sites and your site’s performance often depends on them.

- **`Dedicated Hosting:`**

  - A dedicated hosting service provides dedicated resources (server, hardware, OS, etc.) to its clients without sharing them with anyone else. This gives a lot of flexibility to setup your website the way you want.
